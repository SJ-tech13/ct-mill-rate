First Code for Connecticut meetup event at Upward Hartford, project proposal phase. CT brigade established by Johnathan Payne and Jose Padilla with the support of Ellen Last from Tech Talent South. "Project Mill Rate" proposed by Welley Loc. Originally a personal project, but let's see where this goes with more manpower!

**Purpose of project**

To extract public municipality mill rate data to extrapolate trends in property taxes of CT. This can perhaps shed light upon cost patterns of the past and future, which can influence our overall lifestyle and financial decisions.
